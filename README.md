# cryptoScreen

cryptoScreen leverages Microsoft's FileScreens to block extensions known to be used by Ransomware/Crypto viruses.

This tool was created to be used from Server 2008 (6.0) through to 2019+ (10).

It is a variant/mesh of CryptoBlocker & FSRM-ANTICRYPTO, create to work in a single script and either use the deprecated executables on older OS's or the PowerShell cmdlets on newer.

A huge Kudos to @nexxai and @daviddande and their projects below who had a huge part in creating cryptoScreen
